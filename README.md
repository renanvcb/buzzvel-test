## 📦 Tech Stack

This landing page project runs on the following:

- ⚛️ **React** – because plain JS is so 2009
- 🚀 **Next.js** – for SSR, routing, and bragging rights
- 🎨 **TailwindCSS** – because writing actual CSS is a crime now

## ✅ Pixel-perfect Promise

We solemnly swear (and sometimes cry) that this project is being built **faithful to the prototype** and **in line with the challenge requirements**. No weird margins. No rogue buttons. ~~Maybe some backgrounds and some items positioning.~~ Pure Buzzvel energy.

## 🧠 Here Are the Instructions You’re Tired of Reading

Yes, yes. We all know how this goes. But just in case your terminal forgot:

### Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Then open your browser and sprint to:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

Because nothing beats the feeling of seeing your local server running on port 3000 like a true frontend dev.
